Project Description
This project is a GUI-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to compete, taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game checks for win conditions and tracks the number of wins for each player, as well as draws.

Features
Two-player Mode: 
- Players take turns marking "X" or "O" in the grid.
  
GUI Interface: 
- The game runs with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing, providing buttons for each cell in the 3x3 grid.

Score Tracking: 
- The game maintains a count of wins for both players ("X" and "O") and the number of games that end in a draw.

Win Detection: 
- Automatically detects when a player has won or when the game results in a draw.
